## Introduction to the Framework
The framework serves as a **skeleton** for web automation, utilizing Playwright and JavaScript. It's a foundational structure meant to kickstart new projects, but it's not a complete solution.

- **Playwright**: A tool for browser and API automation.
- **JavaScript**: The programming language used.
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: A design pattern for creating object-oriented code in test scripts.

ðŸ”§ **Libraries and Tools**:
- Playwright for automation.
- JavaScript as the coding language.
- Prettier for code formatting.

ðŸš€ **Commands**:
- `npm install` to set up dependencies.
- `npm run test` for running all tests.
- `npm run test:ui` specifically for UI tests.

ðŸ“Š **Allure Reporting**:
A step-by-step guide to configure Allure for test reporting.
